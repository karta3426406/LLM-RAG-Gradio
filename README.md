#### In conclusion, we've achieved the application of Language Models plus Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for programming language learning, aimed at assisting beginners with overcoming the confusion that can escalate when querying ChatGPT.

#### Our solution employs RAG to narrow down the scope of responses. Users can add PDF documents they wish to learn from and interact with our system through natural language. The system automatically searches these PDFs for answers, correlating the findings with their sources in the documents.

#### This open-source program can be easily adopted in various educational settings. Teachers simply need to add the electronic files of the books they want their students to understand into a designated folder and rerun our software. Students can then effortlessly use natural language conversation to locate relevant knowledge within the books.
